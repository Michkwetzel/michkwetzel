# Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack engineer who transforms ambitious ideas into products that make a real difference. My journey has been anything but conventionalâ€”from a Mechatronics Engineering degree to superyacht engineering across Europe, then AI consulting, and most recently as a founding engineer at a startup. Each step taught me to adapt fast and consistently deliver high quality work.

I'm driven by impact and can own a development cycle end to end. I love what I do and have a passion for building great products.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Drives Me

**Product thinking** shapes how I approach my work. I care deeply about understanding whether we're solving the right problem for the right user. While I know that sometimes you just need to ship and iterate, I believe spending time upfront to validate assumptions leads to products that truly resonateâ€”and saves countless hours of rework down the line.

I'm equally passionate about **solution design**. Having built full-stack production applications solo, I've developed a deep appreciation for the entire journeyâ€”from vision to architecture to launch. There's something uniquely satisfying about figuring out how to turn an ambitious idea into a robust technical reality.

## ðŸ’¼ What I'm Looking For

Right now, I'm seeking my next opportunity with a European company doing work that they believe in. I thrive in hybrid environments where in-person collaboration sparks the best ideas, balanced with the focus that remote work provides when it makes sense.
